   <h3> MEAN Stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.</h3>

<p>MongoDB serves as the database, offering a NoSQL solution for storing and managing application data in a JSON-like format.</p>

<p>Express.js is a lightweight backend web application framework that simplifies server-side programming and API development.</p>

<p>Angular is a powerful front-end framework maintained by Google, used for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</p>

<p>Node.js, as the runtime environment, enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server, making MEAN stack entirely JavaScript-based for seamless development.</p>
