                <p class="card-text">  Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, music, or code, based on patterns learned from data.</p>

                <p>It uses advanced machine learning models, like neural networks, to understand and generate outputs that resemble human creativity.</p>

                <p>Applications of generative AI include chatbots, content creation tools, design assistance, and even drug discovery in healthcare.</p>
                
                <p>Technologies like OpenAI’s GPT (for text) and DALL·E (for images) are prominent examples of generative AI systems.</p>
                
                <p>While generative AI holds immense potential for innovation, it also raises ethical concerns, including copyright issues and the need for responsible use.</p>
