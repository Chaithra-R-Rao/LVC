    <p>
        Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model 
        and analyze complex patterns in data. Inspired by the structure of the human brain, DL excels in tasks like 
        image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.
