    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI) <img width="50" height="50" src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/artificial-intelligence.png" alt="artificial-intelligence"/></h1>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
        that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. AI systems can perform tasks that 
        typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, decision-making, 
        and language translation.

    <h2>Key Areas of AI:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Enables machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Focuses on enabling computers to understand and process human languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual inputs like images and videos.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Systems:</strong> Designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Combines AI with hardware to create robots capable of autonomous actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications of AI:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI is used in diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> AI powers fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management.</li>
        <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Personalized shopping experiences and inventory management rely on AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> AI plays a critical role in self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future of AI:</h2>
    <p>
        The future of AI is highly promising, with advancements in areas like deep learning, 
        neural networks, and general artificial intelligence. AI is expected to revolutionize industries 
        and redefine the way humans interact with technology.
