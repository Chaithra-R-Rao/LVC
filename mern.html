   <h3> MERN Stack is a popular JavaScript-based framework for building full-stack web applications, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.</h3>
    
<p>MongoDB serves as the database, offering a NoSQL solution for storing and managing application data in a JSON-like format.</p>

<p>Express.js is a lightweight backend web application framework that simplifies server-side programming and API development.</p>

<p>React is the front-end library developed by Facebook, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.</p>

<p>Node.js, as the runtime environment, enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server, making MEAN stack entirely JavaScript-based for seamless development.</p>
